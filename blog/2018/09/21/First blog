1:I like this school so far, the teachers are great very kind and understanding, the students are good I Don't have probelms with anyone, I met a lot of amazing people.
2:My own challege is homewwork because sometimes I get lot so I kinda get stressed out.
3:The school is more challeging then I Expected, because the teacher's are more strict then middle school.
