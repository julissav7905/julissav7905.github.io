This week we were working on connecting resprentations and what I learned is that a vaule is a thing that goes together and
turn a place holder into a color it goes at the end of the of the expression.I also identified functions,value and type but 
we need to master them in order to understand alsmost every thing we did or are doing and everthing will become more clear for
everyone.
