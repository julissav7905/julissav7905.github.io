1:we have gotten better at one mic as a class,for example:when Mr.Allata tried to talk we are starting to quiet down faster then before. Also in general how I'm feeling about this class is its kinda challenging. 2:I learned how use github better and created my first blog.A goal I want to achive is to actually know how to use github.we are learning to program.we what we did this week or learn is coordinates battleships and we played a game and observe we did a finish blog upgrade day.we alos did a video game kick of. 3:A challenge I have is my grades for this class and other classes in general becasue I get confused a lot I think I need to pay attention more cuz I get distracted or I'm just tired.
