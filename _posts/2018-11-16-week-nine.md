This week we were able to finish our define vaules. Also we did a group activity. we recorded our thoughts in the white board then we did
like a class gallary and everyone had to write in a post it what their boards had in common and most of it was doing a drawing and 
programming using code and 3D respresntations. so we did a visual representation how we use programming to see the real world a model represntation.

```(exaple(mstery red)
   (rectangle 10 "solid" "red")```

This code represents values, image,string, and numbers. Anything that has quotation marks is a value or a string and a color like "red" or "solid" would represnt that and the image would be the rectangle because its a shape.The 10 represnts the size of the shape.
