This week we took a fall 2018 mid-term exam of lower academy pf computer sciece. AND today we got the analysis of the exam. 
one queston I would like to talk about is question is twenty five. So the question is asking to choose the best
contract that maches the examples they provided. The correct answer is (a) because a contract helps deisgn the software
your creating it works like a contract like in a bussnies but its just in computer science launguage.
The answer (a) is "; match : Image number number" and the examples contain numbers and images and string. 
A string always has quotation marks. An image is a shape. An number is abovouisly a number.
But back to the point (a) is the answer because the example has both a image and number and it has "(" so
it tells the comuter to creat that image with its color and shape sothats already a image and then its combined the number together.
Then theres a number again because at the end of the exampole theres a number again. And (b) was choosen as the best answer because they actually wrote it how the example is but didnt see the end of the creation of the image.
