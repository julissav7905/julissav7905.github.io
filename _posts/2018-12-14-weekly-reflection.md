This week I have beem late or absent because of personal reasons but that made me behind and make teachers think I'm skipping when im not.
But I've been working with Alexis as my parenter and we are going to look for a code for our Irish flag on a project we have to complete.
which to complete is a two week range project. And i'm tryong to improve my grades for this classs and my other classes but its a challenge but I probably could achive it.
